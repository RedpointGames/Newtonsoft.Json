Newtonsoft.Json
========================

Newtonsoft.Json (also known as JSON.NET) is a highly performant JSON serialization library.

This is an updated version of Newtonsoft.Json that uses Protobuild for it's package management.

**IMPORTANT: We are no longer maintaining this repository.**

This repository is no longer being maintained as of Dec 24th 2016.  The latest version of Protobuild has direct support for adding NuGet dependencies, and Protogame now depends on the version of Newtonsoft.Json that is available in NuGet.  This means it is no longer necessary for us to maintain a port of this library with Protobuild as it's package management.

This repository will remain available and in it's existing state for any older versions of Protogame in use.
